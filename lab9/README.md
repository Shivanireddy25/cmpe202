## Comparision of strategy pattern and functional version ##


In this lab, I have implemented strategy pattern for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication for two given numbers and in other case I used functional programming to perform the above operations.



 ### Strategy pattern:

Added a Strategy interface to perform an operation based on the strategy chosen or set.
Displays the result for various strategy(addition, subtraction, multiplication)


 ### Functional Version:

Using the arrow functions, the algorithm of strategy is enclosed rather than writing a concrete class for each kind of strategy.
Printed the outcome of each strategy.

### Observations
First order functions with lambdas can offer the similar functionality which Strategy pattern gives.
